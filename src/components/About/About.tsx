            Hey, I'm Oleksandr Holub and here you will find something about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been in the software engineering field for around 10 years, and it's been an exciting journey so far. Initially, I started as a back-end engineer, but over the past 5 years, I've transitioned into a full-stack role. It's allowed me to have a broader perspective and tackle challenges from both the front and back ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my favorite parts of the job is being responsible for designing new services. I enjoy brainstorming and coming up with innovative solutions that meet the needs of the users and the project goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's a bit about me in a nutshell.
